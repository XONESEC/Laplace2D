# Heat-Conduction with Laplace
In this section, the properties that will be used in the calculation are defined. The required properties are:

* **BC Left** = Boundary condition value (°C for Dirichlet, W/m² for Neumann)

* **BC Right** = Boundary condition value (°C for Dirichlet, W/m² for Neumann)

* **BC Top** = Boundary condition value (°C for Dirichlet, W/m² for Neumann)

* **BC Bottom** = Boundary condition value (°C for Dirichlet, W/m² for Neumann)

* **K** = Thermal Conductivity (W/m-K)

* **Lx** = Length in the x-direction (m)

* **Ly** = Length in the y-direction (m)

* **Nx** = number of grid points in x-direction

* **Ny** = number of grid points in y-direction
